<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the MINISTOP app is to provide visualizations of the longitudinal associations
of physical behaviours (measured at 4 and 9 years old) with body composition and 
physical fitness measured at 9 years old. The visualizations correspond to the paper 
published in (update when published).

The app is hosted at {jhmigueles.shinyapps.io/MINISTOP/}
